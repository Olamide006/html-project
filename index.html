<!-- HOW TO PREPARE -->

<div>
    <P>HOW TO PREPARE</P>
    <p>Parboil(precook) the Rice and set aside</p>
    <ol> 
        <li>
            First, prepare a little stew or sauce .Do this by blending the fresh tomatoes and 
            peppers together;then dry out excess liquid by boiling in a pot for few minutes. ..if you already have tomato
             stew, you can skip this step.Then, Place a pot on heat, add some oil, add chopped onions, fry a bit and then add the blended
              tomatoes & pepper mix, fry for about 10 minutes and then add the tomato puree.Cook until the tomato loses its sour taste and 
              the oil begin to rise to the top.  
        </li> 
<li> 
      Now Scoop out about a quarter of the stew and set it aside for later use.
</li> 

  <li> 
     Add the meat or chicken stock to the pot and leave to boil on high heat for 5-10 minutes.
   Then add the thyme, curry, stock cubes, salt to taste… and any other
    seasoning you like, and boil for 5 minutes.
</li>

<li>
    Next, add the parboiled rice and mix thoroughly; the liquid in the pot should  be at the same level as
     the rice in the pot…you  can add more water if the meat or chicken stock isn’t enough.Cover the pot and leave the
      rice to cook on low to medium heat. High heat will burn the rice before it is well cooked. If you’re using bay leaves, 
      just drop it on the rice before covering the pot.
</li>

<li>
    When the liquid in the rice is almost dried, add the ground crayfish (this is optional) 
    and the remaining stew to the top (don't touch the rice)…cover the pot  and simmer until there is no more liquid in the Rice…Now mix
     thoroughly … and your Nigerian Jollof Rice is Ready.

</li>
</ol>
